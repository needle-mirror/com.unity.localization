# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.5] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed

- Added `LocalizationSettings.ForceRefresh`. This method triggers the `SelectedLocaleChanged` event, which typically forces all subscribing systems to update their displayed content. (LOC-1100)
- Fixed `EditorPropertyDriver.UnregisterProperty` incorrectly calling the `RegisterProperty` method. ([LOC-1195](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1195))
- Fixed an exception that could occur when pulling from a google sheet using API key and it was missing data. ([LOC-1206](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1206))
- Fixed an issue where the `LocalizedString` would remain subscribed to a persistent variable `ValueChanged` event after all `StringChanged` subscribers have been removed. ([LOC-1213](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1213))
- Fixed an issue where the gameobject localizer would try to load assets whilst entering playmode.
- Fixed InvalidOperationException being thrown when using a PersistentVariable as a serialized field. ([LOC-1188](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1188))
- Localization addressable analyzers are now available in Addressables 2.3.1 and above. ([LOC-1193](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1193))
- Support for the device simulator platform override feature was added so you can localize on different platforms in the editor. (LOC-1184)
- The LocalizedString binding editor variable name field is now delayed, so it will not trigger an update while it is being edited.
- Updated to Addressables 1.25.0.

## [1.5.4] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where we would remove an asset from Addressables when it was still being used by another entry. ([LOC-1159](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1159))
- Fixed localized property variant changes not being applied correctly when updating the values via the GameObjectLocalizer inspector. ([LOC-1169](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1169))

- Fixed the Conditional formatter so that it uses the invariant culture when parsing decimal values. ([LOC-1176](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1176))
- Fixed the LocalizedReference dropdown label not updating when the key was renamed. ([LOC-1165](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1166))
- Fixed the LocalizedString property drawer so it does not display "Entry Name" in the corner. ([LOC-1165](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1165))

## [1.5.3] - 2024-09-30

### Added

- Added additional menu options to Tables Window to expose the CSV Extension(s) available for a collection. This enables you to import and export data using custom settings configured through the CSV Extensions on the collection. (LOC-1130)
- Added 'Open(Merge)` and `Import(Merge)' options to the CSV Extension property drawer. (LOC-1130)

### Changed

- Upgraded to Addressables 1.22.2. (LOC-1125)

### Fixed

- Added "None" option to localized string and asset picker. ([LOC-1141](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1141))
- Added support for tracking UGUI Layout Groups via property variants so the layout updates when a locale is changed. This will require re-adding the GameObjectLocalizer as we do not currently have a way to update existing trackers to the new type. ([LOC-1128](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1128))
- Fixed `LocalizationSettings.ProjectLocale` being null when the available locales are not initialized. ([LOC-1139](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1139))

- Fixed `StackOverflowException` when two locales use each other as fallbacks and Preload Behavior is set to Preload Selected Locale And Fallbacks. ([LOC-1119](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1119))
- Fixed an issue where we would parse strings that were not marked as smart. ([LOC-1156](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1156))
- Fixed being able to create cyclic locale fallbacks through the editor. (LOC-1117)
- Fixed TrackedTransform so it correctly applies the locale position and rotation to a tracked GameObject. ([LOC-1148](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1148))

## [1.5.2] - 2024-05-14

### Fixed

- Exporting to an existing CSV file will now replace it instead of over-writing the contents. (LOC-1105). ([LOC-1105](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1105))
- Fixed an issue when comparing locales in the player. We now do a check against the locale contents as well as the reference. ([LOC-1098](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1096))
- Fixed an issue where a table handle could become invalid and still be used. We now reload when this occurs. ([LOC-1098](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1096))
- Removed initialization during preloaded assets phase. This was causing freezing issues when trying to load bundles before any scenes had been loaded. ([ADDR-3664](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ADDR-3664))
- Removed the ability to add a folder to an asset table. This is unsupported. ([LOC-1107](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1107))
- Resolved issues with renaming entries when pulling data from a Google Sheet, particularly in cases where the ID between entries had been swapped. ([LOC-909](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-909))

### Fixed

- Exported XLIFF 1.2 documents will now include the required attribute datatype on the file elements. (LOC-1091)
- Fixed errors in smart strings that contain nested localized strings with additional selectors/formatters when the string table had not yet loaded. ([LOC-1087](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1087))
- Fixed the GameObjectLocalizer not updating if a persistent variable is changed. ([LOC-964](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-964))
- Improved error handling when trying to parse an invalid localized property variant value. ([LOC-1081](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1081))
- Improved performance when removing an item from the Localization Tables Window. ([LOC-1042](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1042))

## [1.5.0-pre.6] - 2024-01-31

### Changed

- CSV files will now be exported in UTF8 without the unesessesary byte order mark (BOM).

- Removed the Locale Source option from the **Locale Generator** window.
- Renamed **Locale Generator** to **Add Locale** in Localization Settings.

### Fixed

- A locale change event is no longer sent in playmode when a change is detected to the localization tables. This is now only done in edit mode when previewing a locale via the localization scene controls. ([LOC-1025](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1025))
- Fixed incorrect calculation of string table row height in the Table window. ([LOC-1058](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1058))
- Improved handling of dependency operations that may be released after execution. The localization initialization operation will no longer fail during WaitForCompletion when the addressable initialization operation is automatically released. ([LOC-1039](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1039))
- Improved null handling of `TrackedProperties` values when something went wrong during serialization.
- We now fail the initialization operation if one of the sub-operations fails. ([LOC-1038](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1038))

## [1.5.0-pre.3] - 2023-11-30

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with version defines that was failing to detect 2023.3.

## [1.5.0-pre.2] - 2023-11-27

### Fixed

- Added back in removed API for `ProjectLocalePopupField` and `LocalizationTablesWindow` to avoid making breaking changes to API.

## [1.5.0-pre.1] - 2023-11-21

### Added

- Added `AsynchronousBehavior` to string and asset database. These can be used to set a global `WaitForCompletion` flag instead of having to set it on every `LocalizedAsset` and `LocalizedString`.
- Added `LocalizationImportMenuAttribute`, `LocalizationExportMenuAttribute` and `LocalizationEntryMenuAttribute`. These can be used to add custom menu items to the Localization Tables window.
- Added support for UI Toolkit data bindings. Localized strings and assets can now be added as data bindings to UI Toolkit elements. See docs for more details.

### Changed

- Improved performance of localization object pools and releasing.
- The Localization Tables window has had several UX improvements made. (LOC-214)

### Deprecated

- `ProjectLocalePopupField` and `XliffVersionPopup` `UxmlFactory` and `UxmlTraits` are now obsolete when using Unity 2023.2 and above.

### Fixed

- Added `IDisposable` support to property drawers. This will cleanup resources and reduce the subscribers to editor events helping performance when entering playmode. Note, this also requires the Editor changes that add `IDisposable` support to property drawers.
- Fixed `GetAllTables` `WaitForCompletion` never finishing when run outside of playmode. ([LOC-1011](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1011))
- Fixed `LocalizationSettings` not initializing in the player until the first request was made. ([LOC-975](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-975))
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` when calling GetAllTables outside of playmode and no editor locale was selected. ([LOC-1011](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1011))
- Fixed exception being thrown from `WaitForCurrentOperationAsyncOperationBase ` when the dependency became invalid after `WaitForCompletion` was called on it. We now fail the operation instead. ([LOC-992](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-992))
- Fixed the TableReference field losing its value when `OnAfterDeserialize` was called multiple times.
Fixed the layout of the localized reference field dropdown and buttons. ([LOC-985](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-985))
- Initialization operation will now wait for any asynchronous bundle unloading to complete before beginning initialization. This fixes the error "Table does not have a SharedTableData". ([LOC-1021](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1021))

## [1.4.5] - 2023-09-20

### Fixed

- Added handling of null `StringReference`/`AssetReference` reference to `LocalizedAssetBehaviour` and `LocalizedStringEvent`. ([LOC-945](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-942))
- Fixed "Objects are trying to be loaded during a domain backup" error occurring on empty `TableReferences` during serialization. ([LOC-969](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-969))
- Fixed `StringTableEntry.IsSmart` from not detecting if the entry was marked smart when its local `SmartFormatTag` metadata was missing but it was still registered in the `SmartFormatTag`. ([LOC-966](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-966))
- Fixed an issue that would cause sprites/textures to flicker when the locale was changed. This was due to us unloading the previous locale's assets before the new ones were available. The `LocalizedAsset` now holds onto the asset handle until its new one has finished loading. ([LOC-976](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-976))
- Fixed compilation errors when using Addressables 2.0.0.
- Fixed Create Table window controls being hidden when a large number of locales were in the project,. (LOC-913)

## [1.4.4] - 2023-06-15

### Changed

- Added support for TMP now being part of the UGUI package in 2023.2.
- Updated obsolete Unity Search API `QueryEngine.Parse` to now use `QueryEngine.ParseQuery` on Unity 2022.2+.
- Updated to Addressables `1.21.8`. (LOC-704)
- Updated to use the Editor XCODE public API when using 2023.1 and above.

### Fixed

- Added multi-line edit support to `name` field in `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset` property drawers. (LOC-875)
- Fixed an error in the device simulator when the project contained no locales. (LOC-888)
- Fixed device simulator Localization menu not showing in 2021.1 and above.
- Fixed preload locale operation not being released when it was completed instantly.
- Fixed tables returned by `GetAllTables` sometimes being released and destroyed. ([LOC-882](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-882))
- Fixed the "Expected to have a current operation to wait on" error when initializing localization before Addressables initialization during a WaitForCompletion call. ([LOC-929](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-929))
- Fixed the **Google Sheet Service Provider** - **Application Name** losing its value after asset creation. ([LOC-864](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-864))
- Improved WaitForCompletion code so that it can handle failed dependencies and won't get stuck in an infinite loop. ([LOC-929](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-929))
- Reenabled code that ensures localization processes assets after Addressables. This was disabled in 1.3.1. (LOC-704)
- Removing an entry from a table will now update the shared metadata. ([LOC-870](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-870))

## [1.4.3] - 2023-01-13

### Fixed

- An empty search string will now show all entries in the `LocalizedAsset` and `LocalizedString` popup instead of nothing. ([LOC-785](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-string-value-search-returns-0-string-tables-when-no-characters-are-given-to-search-by))
- Default IOS localized fields are no longer set to empty strings. We now use the project locale values as the defaults. (LOC-804)
- Fixed `AmbiguousMatchException` when building to IOS. ([LOC-855](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-855))
- Fixed Tag & Shared metadata being duplicated on an entry when they were added multiple times. For example, setting `StringTableEntry.IsSmart` to `true` when it was already `true` would cause 2 `SmartFormatTag` to be added to the metadata. ([LOC-779](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-779))
- Fixed the Table Editor search not checking the first 2 string table columns. ([LOC-820](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-820))
- The Active Editor Locale will now persist between Editor sessions. ([LOC-787](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-787))
- The Table Editor will no longer draw alternating background bars in the remaining space. (LOC-842)

## [1.4.2] - 2022-09-27

### Added

- Added support for tracking a [MeshFilter](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MeshFilter.html) when using **Localized Property Variants**. (LOC-719)
- Added **Preload Behavior** to **Localization Settings**. This allows further control over which assets to preload, such as loading fallback assets as well as the selected locale. (LOC-762)
- Added `ITableProvider` and `ITablePostProcessor`. These let you provide tables from custom localizations and to apply changes to a table when it first loads. (LOC-673)
- Added `LoadAssetAsync<TObject>()` to `LocalizedAssetBase`. This helps to filter sub-assets when trying to load them and they share a common type among other sub-assets with the same name. (LOC-793)
- Added `LocalizationEditorEvents.ExtensionAddedToCollection` & `LocalizationEditorEvents.ExtensionRemovedFromCollection`, which you can use to react to collection extension additions & removals. Added `CollectionExtension.Destroy()` which you can use to perform cleanup when a collection extension is removed. (LOC-685)
- Added `LocalizedMesh` class to support localizing mesh assets.
- Added a step to the **Asset Table Addressables Analyzer** that checks if sub-assets are referenced by name and offers to upgrade them. (LOC-793)
- Added support for [IConvertible](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iconvertible) to Plural and Conditional Smart String formatters. This uses the `ToDecimal` method when a numeric value is required for evaluating the object. (LOC-778)
- Added support for `SystemLanguage.Hindi` in Unity 2022.2 and above. (LOC-672)
- Added support for drawing the enum values in the `GameObjectLocalizer` editor when tracking an enum property. (LOC-684)
- Added support for referencing sub-assets. Previously we would only address the main asset and extract the sub-asset by matching the type. This was unpredictable when the main asset was the same type or contained multiple sub-assets with the same type. We now address the sub-asset by name so that we can ensure we get it correctly regardless of the type or number of other sub-assets. (LOC-793)
- Added the 'NoTranslationFound' event to allow users to register to the callback whenever an entry doesn't have a translation. (LOC-688)

### Changed

- An exception is now thrown when attempting to add a built-in resource to an Asset Table when using `AssetTableCollection.AddAssetToTable`. Addressables doesn't currently support built-in resources. Create a local copy if you need to use a built-in resource.
- Updated Google Sheets API to 1.57.0.2720 and Newtonsoft.Json API to 13.0.1. (LOC-250)
- Updated to Addressables 1.20.5.
- When possible, the **CSV Extension** now stores the file path as relative to the project when using the **Save...** and **Open...** commands.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated API `LocalizedString.CurrentLoadingOperation` and `LocalizedAsset.CurrentLoadingOperation` now produce errors when used.

### Fixed

- Fixed **Google Sheets** `CreateMappingsFromColumnNames` not using `Locale.LocaleName` when considering possible Locale names.
- Fixed `InvalidOperationException: Stack empty` when using **GoogleSheets** extension on Linux. ([LOC-698](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-698))
- Fixed `ListFormatter` missing the spacer when extracting literal characters from a Smart String.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` during Edit mode when calling `GetLocalizedString` on a smart but empty StringTableEntry. (LOC-754)
- Fixed errors when exiting playmode with **Enter playmode** support enabled and **use built addressables playmode**. ([LOC-722](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-722))
- Fixed file path not being saved when using **CSV Extension** **Save...** and **Open...** commands. ([LOC-751](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-751))
- Fixed freeze when an invalid Smart String was called with `WaitForCompletion` and throw exception was enabled in the settings. (LOC-768)
- Fixed LocalizedString preview not working when the instance was nested inside of a serialized class. ([LOC-812](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-812))
- Fixed newly created collections having `preload` enabled by default.
- Improved Addressables operations management. Fixed several issues that would cause an addressable operation to be leaked and the asset not released. ([LOC-794](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-794))
- Improved the **Missing Tables** list in the **Table Collection Editor** so it doesn't return false positives, which causes the "Create" button to become disabled. ([LOC-800](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-800))

## [1.3.2] - 2022-06-01

### Changed

- Changed CSV Extension "Open..." button so it performs a full import instead of a merge. ([LOC-540](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-540))
- Disabled fix for "New localization assets created automatically and/or old assets are modified when loading project without Library folder ([LOC-400](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-400))" on Unity 2019.4 to 2021.3. This is due to a bug in Addressables (ADDR-2521). This fix will be re-enabled in the future. (LOC-704)
- Updated dependency `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` to 2.0.2.

### Fixed

- Fixed `NullReferenceException` when creating a new table that takes name from renamed table. ([LOC-550](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-creating-a-table-that-takes-name-from-renamed-table))
- Fixed `GameObjectLocalizer` failing to apply local asset references in Unity versions before 2022.2. ([LOC-714](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-714))
- Fixed `LocalizedStringTable` and `LocalizedAssetTable` property drawer not setting `GUI.changed` when the reference was changed. ([LOC-725](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-725))
- Fixed Asset Tables being destroyed during preloading. ([LOC-727](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-727))
- Improved `FormatException` error message when `String.Format` throws during `GetLocalizedString`.
- String Table entries will no longer try to use `String.Format` when using `GetLocalizedString` with non-null but empty arguments. ([LOC-689](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-formatexception-error-is-thrown-in-the-console-window-when-calling-getlocalizedstringasync-class))

## [1.3.1] - 2022-04-14

### Added

- Added **Localize Property** context menu to properties in the Inspector. This can be used as an alternative to the **Track Changes** option to manually add the property as a **Localized Property Variant**. The menu item **Remove Localized Property** removes properties. The menu item **Remove Localized Property Variant** removes a specific selected Locale's override. (LOC-358)
- Added `RemoveTrackedProperty` to `TrackedObject`.
- Added support to handle a locale that has multiple fallbacks defined. ([LOC-607](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-607))

### Changed

- Localized string and asset variants that are empty (no table or entry set) will no longer produce errors and will be ignored.
- Replaced the `Locale Code` field in the Pseudo localization editor with a `Source Locale` field that only lets you select a locale in the project. (LOC-611)
- Updated to Addressables `1.19.19`.

### Deprecated

- Replaced `Locale.GetFallback` with `Locale.GetFallbacks` in order to support multiple fallbacks per locale. ([LOC-607](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-607))

### Fixed

- Fixed `LocalesProvider.AddLocale` ignoring the locale being added when a potential fallback was already in the provider.
- Fixed `LocalizedDatabase.GetTableAsync` creating a new operation each time when requesting a table that had not yet loaded. This would consume more memory than was necessary.
- Fixed `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset` not showing prefab overrides in the Inspector. (LOC-592)
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` being thrown when applying property variants and the project locale was null. ([LOC-601](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-are-thrown-in-play-mode-when-project-locale-identifier-is-not-set-in-localization-settings))
- Fixed bug where calling `RefreshString`, when the loading operation had not completed, would cause `RefreshString` to execute twice.
- Fixed build failures on Android Platform when System Language is used as Locale Source for Chinese (Simplified) & Chinese (Traditional). (LOC-681)
- Fixed console errors and warnings when making changes in the Inspector and the project was not configured for localization.
- Fixed duplicating of Addressable assets when importing a project with no library folder. (LOC-400)
- Fixed errors when trying to create a table in the Packages directory. ([LOC-614](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-assets-cannot-be-created-inside-embedded-packages))
- Fixed fallback not working when the fallback had a missing table.
- Fixed operations being released immediately in edit mode, this could cause data to be lost too soon. ([LOC-667](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/getlocalizedstring-returns-null-when-the-editor-is-not-in-play-mode))
- Fixed operations sometimes being released too soon, which could cause them to be released before the yield on the operation had executed.
- Fixed Psuedo locale editor using the incorrect field for the locale name.
- Fixed Unity freezing when calling `WaitForCompletion` on a string operation that threw an exception during formatting. (LOC-630)
- Improved automatic releasing of operations so that we no longer use `CompletedTypeless`, which generates GC.
- Improved memory management to reduce the amount of garbage being generated by internal operations and adding/removing events. (LOC-571)
- Reduced allocations when applying Localized Property variants and the string/asset operation was still loading. (LOC-480)

## [1.2.1] - 2022-02-14

### Added

- Added **Import/CSV(Merge)** to only update the entries in the CSV. ([LOC-540](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-table-editor-does-not-remove-extra-rows-when-opening-csv-file-with-lower-rows-count))
- Added **Page Controls** to the **Table editor**. This limits the number of items visible at one time and helps to improve the performance when dealing with large tables. ([LOC-474](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localizations-string-table-update-time-is-low-when-working-with-many-entries))
- Added `GetRowEnumeratorUnsorted` to `LocalizationTableCollection.cs`, this allows for stepping through the rows in the same order as the `SharedTableData`.
- Added SetTable and SetEntry methods to LocalizedStringEvents. These can be used with UnityEvents to update localized strings. (LOC-377)

### Changed

- **Import/CSV** will now replace the contents and remove missing entries. ([LOC-540](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-table-editor-does-not-remove-extra-rows-when-opening-csv-file-with-lower-rows-count))
- CSV export now exports the rows in the same order as the `SharedTableData`. ([LOC-588](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-558))
- Improved some menu items UX by renaming to include ellipses ("...") when the action requires additional input.
- Updated to Addressables `1.19.17`.

### Fixed

- Fix null reference exceptions been thrown when Custom Locale does not use Custom Formatter. (LOC-526)

- Renamed `LocalizeString.GetLocalizedString` to `LocalizeString.GetLocalizedStringAsync`.
- System Locale Selector will now only output the message The Locale X is not available, however the parent locale Y is available. in the player.
- Updated Smart Format library to `aa9e4288612f79b86ab0cea36066797118d11a69` excluding the Nullable types support.
  - Fixed: Take an erroneous format string like `"this is {uncomplete"` (missing closing brace). Before v2.7.0 the parser handled `{uncomplete` as a `TextLiteral`, not as an erroneous `Placeholder`.
  - Fixed: Fixed issue where If the `Parser` encountered a `ParsingError.TooManyClosingBraces`, this closing brace was simply "swallowed-up". This way, the result with `Parser.ErrorAction.MaintainTokens` differs from the original format string. From v2.7.0, the redundant closing brace is handled as a `TextLiteral`. 
  - Improved: For `ParsingError.TrailingOperatorsInSelector` and `ParsingError.InvalidCharactersInSelector` the causing character is now included in the `Exception.Message`.
  - Fix: Fully implemented all `Settings.ParseErrorAction`.

- Added language change menu to Device Simulator window.
- Added metadata support to **LocalizationSettings**.
- Added method `TableEntryReference.ToString(TableReference)`. This will use the `TableReference` to gather additional data such as the **Key** or **Key Id**.
- Added support for localizing **Android App name**. Only the **Display Name** is currently supported on the Android Platform. To configure the Android App add the **Android/AppInfo** metadata to the LocalizationSettings.
- Added support for localizing Android app Icon. We currently support  Adaptive Icon, Round Icon, and Legacy Icon on the Android Platform. To configure the Android app icons, add the Android/Android Adaptive Icon or Android/Android Round Icon or Android/Android Legacy Icon metadata to the LocalizationSettings.

## [0.10.0] - 2021-01-20

### Added 

- Added `GetDefaultTableAsync` to `LocalizedDatabase`. This can be used to get the DefaultTable directly. 
- Added `HasChangeHandler` to `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset`. ([LOC-111](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-unable-to-check-if-registerchangehandler-is-null-when-using-localisestringevent))
- Added `GenerateCharacterSet` to `StringTable` and `StringTableCollection`. This can be used to extract the unique characters used by 1 or more `String Tables`. This could then be used with a Font Atlas creator. It is also possible to export a **Character Set** file from the Export menu of the String Table window, the String Table Collection window, or the Localization Tables window.
- Added new Google Sheets example `SmartStringColumn` for synchronizing the Smart String property of an entry.
- Added **Global Variables** to **Smart Strings**. **Global Variables** can be defined in a `GlobalVariableGroup` asset which can then be added to a `GlobalVariableSource` in the **Smart Format Sources** list. Variables can then be referenced in a **Smart String** without the need to pass arguments. For example: `{group-name.variable-name}`. When a `GlobalVariables` value is changed via script, it will automatically trigger any `LocalizedString` that is using it to refresh. See Samples and docs for further details.
- Added `HasTagMetadata` to `TableEntry`.
- Added PreLoadTables to LocalizedDatabase. This can be used to force tables to be loaded, including their contents without having to set the preload flag in the editor.
- Added fallback support. When a localized value is missing then the Locale fallback metadata or CultureInfo will be used to find a suitable fallback Locale. This can be enabled project-wide through the Localization Settings String Database or Asset Database, it can also be configured on a per-item basis for LocalizedStrings.
- Added useFallback parameter to LocalizedStringDatabase.GetLocalizedStringAsync & LocalizedDatabase.GetTableEntryAsync. This can be used as a flag to enable FallBack behavior for Locales that have missing translations.
- Added Custom Locale UI Window. This can be used to add any custom Locales that are not supported in CultureInfo class or the SystemLanguage.
- Added **Preloading Screen** sample. This shows how you can wait for the `InitializationOperation` to complete.

### Changed
- Reduced the amount of garbage being generated by requests for localized strings and assets. The operations inside of `AsyncOperationHandle` are now returned in the subsequent frame after completion. If you wish to hold onto an `AsyncOperationHandle` you should call `Addressables.ResourceManager.Acquire` to prevent the operation being reused and `Addressables.Release` to allow for it to be reused.
- Merged all Third Party dependencies into a single library **Unity.Localization.ThirdParty.Editor.dll**. This will prevent conflicts when projects/packages use the same libraries. **Google Sheets**, **Newtonsoft Json** and **CsvHelper** can still be accessed by adding **Unity.Localization.ThirdParty.Editor** as an **Assembly Reference** to your own asmdef files.
- Removed dependency on package **com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json**. It is now part of the combined dependencies.
- Updated Third Party dependencies. Google Sheets to v.1.49.0.2111, CsvHelper to 15.0.9 and Newtonsoft.Json to 12.0.3.
- Clicking the **Localized Table Collection** name label will now toggle the selector foldout for `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset`. ([LOC-125](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-125))
- Significant improvements to **Smart String** overall performance. Testing showed results of an average of 10x less garbage and runs 2-3x faster.
- Updated **Smart Strings** with changes from **SmartFormat** v2.5.3.0-preview1.
  - Internal string comparisons (i.e. for placeholder names) are no more culture-specific, but Ordinal or OrdinalIgnoreCase respectively.
  - ListFormatter will now process IList data sources only.
  - Removed **SmartObjects**
- Updated to **Addressables** 1.6.13. 
- It's now possible to import `StringTableCollections` and `AssetTableCollections` into new or existing projects. When importing the Collection will create/update the Addressables and create any missing Locales in the project.
- Changed sample **Language Selection Menu (UGUI)** to use the Native name for Locales.
- The `Localization Tables` window search field is no longer cleared when changing selected table.
- After pulling from a **Google Sheet**, the order of the keys in the table will now match the order of the **Google Sheet**.
- When pushing to a **Google Sheet**, Table entries will no longer be sorted by the Key Id but keep their current order, as shown in the table editor window.
- It is now possible to use a **Google Sheet** with Sheet Id 0.
- Creating a new `LocalizationSettings` asset in the **Project Settings** window no longer selects the asset.
- Setting `LocalizedString` `Arguments` will now trigger `RefreshString`.
- `LocalizedString.RefreshString` will no longer throw an exception if there are no `StringChanged` subscribers.
- `LocalizedStrings` that are **Smart** will always use **Smart Format** even when no arguments have been provided.
- Culture-sensitive formatting now uses the `Locale` information.
- The `Localization Tables` window search field is no longer cleared when changing selected table.
- The `Localization Tables` window search field is no longer cleared when changing selected table.
- No Translation Found message is now a Smart String and has access to several placeholders which can be used to proivide details on the missing entry. 

### Fixed
- Fixed exceptions being thrown when trying to load a table that does not exist. Loading missing String Tables will now use the missing translation message instead of throwing an exception when a table was missing and assets will return a failed operation handle. (LOC-120)
- Fixed DefaultTable property throwing an invalid key exception when it is empty. Now getting a value from empty DefaultTable will throw an exception. 
- The LocalizedAsset selector will now filter out incompatible types. ([LOC-123](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localizedasset-property-drawer-does-not-filter-by-type))
- Fixed **LocalizedString** Editor not preserving new items added to the Preview Arguments field. ([LOC-122](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/new-items-are-not-added-to-the-preview-arguments-list-in-the-localizedstring-field-when-pressing-the-plus-icon))
- Fixed `AddTagMetadata` creating a new tag each time instead of using an existing tag. `RemoveTagMetadata` will now remove all empty tag entries, not just the first one it finds. ([LOC-124](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/smart-format-tag-in-the-metadata-stays-after-disabling-the-smart-option-when-smart-option-is-enabled-on-another-entry))
- **String Table Entries** which have a null or empty localized string will now be treated as missing translations and use the `No Translation Found Format`. ([LOC-126](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-no-translation-found-format-variable-isnt-used-when-an-entry-locale-is-empty))
- Fixed exception when calling GetLocale and no Addressables settings exists in the project.
- Fixed **XLIFF 2.0** generating empty **notes** nodes. ([LOC-131](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-export-xliff-generates-table-with-notes-node-when-notes-are-not-added))
- Fixed **Google Sheets** `PullEnd` not being called after pulling from a Google Sheet. ([LOC-133](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/googlesheets-does-not-call-pullend-on-custom-columns))
- **Google Sheets** `PullCellData` is now called for all cells even if the sheet cell is empty. (LOC-134)
- Pulling a **Google Sheet** using an **API Key** will now use the correct public API and no longer produce authorization errors. ([LOC-139](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-using-api-key-to-retrieve-data-outputs-request-is-missing-required-authentication-credential-expected-oauth-2))
- Calling `LocalizationEditorSettings.GetLocales` will no longer create a new Addressable Assets Settings file if one does not exist. ([LOC-142](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/a-new-addresableassetsdata-folder-is-created-when-recompiling-a-script-while-the-localization-tables-window-is-open))
- Fixed a bug where the Locales list were not been updated, when the New Table tab is open and the Locale name was changed.
- Improved `LocalizationSetting` editor performance. The editor is now using UI Toolkit to render and should be much smoother. (LOC-90)
- Fixed **Smart String** editor becoming corrupted when a parsing exception was thrown in the **Debug** view.
- Fixed exception being thrown by `GetSourceExtension` and `GetFormatterExtension` when no value could be found.

### Added
- Added support for exporting and importing `StringTables` and `StringTableCollections` as XML Localisation Interchange File Format (XLIFF). XLIFF version [1.2](https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html) and [2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.0/os/xliff-core-v2.0-os.html) are both supported. See docs for further details.

### Changed
- Updated to Addressables version **1.16.6**.
- Editor Foldout fields now toggle when clicking on the label.
- When enabling preload on Asset Tables, all assets will now be preloaded by default instead of requiring the `PreloadAssetTable` Metadata. Adding a `PreloadAssetTable` can be used to disable this default behavior. ([LOC-114](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localized-audio-clips-fail-to-load-on-first-retrieval-when-using-loadassetasync))
- `SmartFormat` editor will now show parsing and format errors in the preview field.

- Fixed Tables Window throwing exceptions when editing a collection which had 1 or more tables without a matching locale in the project.
- Fixed `ProjectSettings.asset` being modified on disc during a build.
- Fixed `LocalizedString` property drawer throwing `NullReferenceException` when selecting a Localization Table Collection which did not have a table for every Locale in the project. ([LOC-118](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-thrown-when-editing-a-localizedstring-linked-to-a-collection-that-does-not-have-a-table-for-every-project-locale))

By default `DistributedUIDGenerator` will be used to generate the keys however it is possible to change it back to Sequential by assigning `SequentialIDGenerator` to `SharedTableData.KeyGenerator`. See docs for further details.
- Added `PreserveTags` Pseudo-localization method. This will prevent tags such as rich text or xml from being modified by any subsequent Pseudo-localization methods. ([LOC-86](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/pseudo-localization-methods-are-applied-to-the-whole-string-when-using-rich-text-tags))

## [0.7.1] - 2020-06-05

### Added
- Added `StringTableCollection` and `AssetTableCollection`. These are editor only assets for controlling a collection of string or asset tables. Tables that are not part of a collection will now be ignored. To upgrade old table assets select one and press the `Create Collection` button in the inspector.
- Added Google Sheets support. A `StringTableCollection` can by pushed and pulled by using the `Google Sheets Extension` in the editor or through script with the `GoogleSheets` class. Table entry values, comments and metadata can be synced to a Google Sheet. This is currently an Editor only feature.
- Added `DisplayName` attribute. This is an optional attribute for `Metadata` and `CollectionExtensions` so that a custom name that can be displayed in the editor instead of the class name.
