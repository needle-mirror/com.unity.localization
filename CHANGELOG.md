- Updated to Addressables `1.21.8`. (LOC-704)
- Updated to use the Editor XCODE public API when using 2023.1 and above.

### Fixed

- Added multi-line edit support to `name` field in `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset` property drawers. (LOC-875)
- Fixed an error in the device simulator when the project contained no locales. (LOC-888)
- Fixed device simulator Localization menu not showing in 2021.1 and above.
- Fixed preload locale operation not being released when it was completed instantly.
- Fixed tables returned by `GetAllTables` sometimes being released and destroyed. ([LOC-882](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-882))
- Fixed the "Expected to have a current operation to wait on" error when initializing localization before Addressables initialization during a WaitForCompletion call. ([LOC-929](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-929))
- Fixed the **Google Sheet Service Provider** - **Application Name** losing its value after asset creation. ([LOC-864](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-864))
- Improved WaitForCompletion code so that it can handle failed dependencies and won't get stuck in an infinite loop. ([LOC-929](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-929))
- Reenabled code that ensures localization processes assets after Addressables. This was disabled in 1.3.1. (LOC-704)
- Removing an entry from a table will now update the shared metadata. ([LOC-870](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-870))

## [1.4.3] - 2023-01-13

### Fixed

- An empty search string will now show all entries in the `LocalizedAsset` and `LocalizedString` popup instead of nothing. ([LOC-785](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-string-value-search-returns-0-string-tables-when-no-characters-are-given-to-search-by))
- Default IOS localized fields are no longer set to empty strings. We now use the project locale values as the defaults. (LOC-804)
- Fixed `AmbiguousMatchException` when building to IOS. ([LOC-855](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-855))
- Fixed Tag & Shared metadata being duplicated on an entry when they were added multiple times. For example, setting `StringTableEntry.IsSmart` to `true` when it was already `true` would cause 2 `SmartFormatTag` to be added to the metadata. ([LOC-779](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-779))
- Fixed the Table Editor search not checking the first 2 string table columns. ([LOC-820](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-820))
- The Active Editor Locale will now persist between Editor sessions. ([LOC-787](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-787))
- The Table Editor will no longer draw alternating background bars in the remaining space. (LOC-842)

## [1.4.2] - 2022-09-27

### Added

- Added support for tracking a [MeshFilter](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MeshFilter.html) when using **Localized Property Variants**. (LOC-719)
- Added **Preload Behavior** to **Localization Settings**. This allows further control over which assets to preload, such as loading fallback assets as well as the selected locale. (LOC-762)
- Added `ITableProvider` and `ITablePostProcessor`. These let you provide tables from custom localizations and to apply changes to a table when it first loads. (LOC-673)
- Added `LoadAssetAsync<TObject>()` to `LocalizedAssetBase`. This helps to filter sub-assets when trying to load them and they share a common type among other sub-assets with the same name. (LOC-793)
- Added `LocalizationEditorEvents.ExtensionAddedToCollection` & `LocalizationEditorEvents.ExtensionRemovedFromCollection`, which you can use to react to collection extension additions & removals. Added `CollectionExtension.Destroy()` which you can use to perform cleanup when a collection extension is removed. (LOC-685)
- Added `LocalizedMesh` class to support localizing mesh assets.
- Added a step to the **Asset Table Addressables Analyzer** that checks if sub-assets are referenced by name and offers to upgrade them. (LOC-793)
- Added support for [IConvertible](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iconvertible) to Plural and Conditional Smart String formatters. This uses the `ToDecimal` method when a numeric value is required for evaluating the object. (LOC-778)
- Added support for `SystemLanguage.Hindi` in Unity 2022.2 and above. (LOC-672)
- Added support for drawing the enum values in the `GameObjectLocalizer` editor when tracking an enum property. (LOC-684)
- Added support for referencing sub-assets. Previously we would only address the main asset and extract the sub-asset by matching the type. This was unpredictable when the main asset was the same type or contained multiple sub-assets with the same type. We now address the sub-asset by name so that we can ensure we get it correctly regardless of the type or number of other sub-assets. (LOC-793)
- Added the 'NoTranslationFound' event to allow users to register to the callback whenever an entry doesn't have a translation. (LOC-688)

### Changed

- An exception is now thrown when attempting to add a built-in resource to an Asset Table when using `AssetTableCollection.AddAssetToTable`. Addressables doesn't currently support built-in resources. Create a local copy if you need to use a built-in resource.
- Updated Google Sheets API to 1.57.0.2720 and Newtonsoft.Json API to 13.0.1. (LOC-250)
- Updated to Addressables 1.20.5.
- When possible, the **CSV Extension** now stores the file path as relative to the project when using the **Save...** and **Open...** commands.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated API `LocalizedString.CurrentLoadingOperation` and `LocalizedAsset.CurrentLoadingOperation` now produce errors when used.

### Fixed

- Fixed **Google Sheets** `CreateMappingsFromColumnNames` not using `Locale.LocaleName` when considering possible Locale names.
- Fixed `InvalidOperationException: Stack empty` when using **GoogleSheets** extension on Linux. ([LOC-698](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-698))
- Fixed `ListFormatter` missing the spacer when extracting literal characters from a Smart String.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` during Edit mode when calling `GetLocalizedString` on a smart but empty StringTableEntry. (LOC-754)
- Fixed errors when exiting playmode with **Enter playmode** support enabled and **use built addressables playmode**. ([LOC-722](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-722))
- Fixed file path not being saved when using **CSV Extension** **Save...** and **Open...** commands. ([LOC-751](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-751))
- Fixed freeze when an invalid Smart String was called with `WaitForCompletion` and throw exception was enabled in the settings. (LOC-768)
- Fixed LocalizedString preview not working when the instance was nested inside of a serialized class. ([LOC-812](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-812))
- Fixed newly created collections having `preload` enabled by default.
- Improved Addressables operations management. Fixed several issues that would cause an addressable operation to be leaked and the asset not released. ([LOC-794](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-794))
- Improved the **Missing Tables** list in the **Table Collection Editor** so it doesn't return false positives, which causes the "Create" button to become disabled. ([LOC-800](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-800))

## [1.3.2] - 2022-06-01

### Changed

- Changed CSV Extension "Open..." button so it performs a full import instead of a merge. ([LOC-540](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-540))
- Disabled fix for "New localization assets created automatically and/or old assets are modified when loading project without Library folder ([LOC-400](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-400))" on Unity 2019.4 to 2021.3. This is due to a bug in Addressables (ADDR-2521). This fix will be re-enabled in the future. (LOC-704)
- Updated dependency `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` to 2.0.2.

### Fixed

- Fixed `NullReferenceException` when creating a new table that takes name from renamed table. ([LOC-550](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-creating-a-table-that-takes-name-from-renamed-table))

## [1.3.1] - 2022-04-14

### Added

- Added **Localize Property** context menu to properties in the Inspector. This can be used as an alternative to the **Track Changes** option to manually add the property as a **Localized Property Variant**. The menu item **Remove Localized Property** removes properties. The menu item **Remove Localized Property Variant** removes a specific selected Locale's override. (LOC-358)
- Added `RemoveTrackedProperty` to `TrackedObject`.
- Added support to handle a locale that has multiple fallbacks defined. ([LOC-607](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-607))

### Changed

- Localized string and asset variants that are empty (no table or entry set) will no longer produce errors and will be ignored.
- Replaced the `Locale Code` field in the Pseudo localization editor with a `Source Locale` field that only lets you select a locale in the project. (LOC-611)
- Updated to Addressables `1.19.19`.

### Deprecated

- Replaced `Locale.GetFallback` with `Locale.GetFallbacks` in order to support multiple fallbacks per locale. ([LOC-607](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-607))

### Fixed

- Fixed `LocalesProvider.AddLocale` ignoring the locale being added when a potential fallback was already in the provider.
- Fixed `LocalizedDatabase.GetTableAsync` creating a new operation each time when requesting a table that had not yet loaded. This would consume more memory than was necessary.
- Fixed `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset` not showing prefab overrides in the Inspector. (LOC-592)
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` being thrown when applying property variants and the project locale was null. ([LOC-601](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-are-thrown-in-play-mode-when-project-locale-identifier-is-not-set-in-localization-settings))

- Fixed operations being released immediately in edit mode, this could cause data to be lost too soon. ([LOC-667](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/getlocalizedstring-returns-null-when-the-editor-is-not-in-play-mode))
- Fixed operations sometimes being released too soon, which could cause them to be released before the yield on the operation had executed.
- Fixed Psuedo locale editor using the incorrect field for the locale name.
- Fixed Unity freezing when calling `WaitForCompletion` on a string operation that threw an exception during formatting. (LOC-630)
- Improved automatic releasing of operations so that we no longer use `CompletedTypeless`, which generates GC.
- Improved memory management to reduce the amount of garbage being generated by internal operations and adding/removing events. (LOC-571)
- Reduced allocations when applying Localized Property variants and the string/asset operation was still loading. (LOC-480)

## [1.0.0-pre.9] - 2021-05-12

### Added

- Added `ExcludeEntry` **Metadata** . This can be used to prevent an entry from being exported to Google Sheets, XLIFF, and CSV.
- Added `WaitForCompletion` property to `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset`. This can be set in the inspector or via script to force synchronous loading.
- Added synchronous methods to `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset`.

### Changed

- `LocalizationSettings.SelectedLocale` is now syncronous and does not need Initialization to have been completed.
- Moved `TryEvaluateAllLiterals` into its own interface `IFormatterLiteralExtractor` and renamed to `WriteAllLiterals`.
- Renamed `LocalizeString.GetLocalizedString` to `LocalizeString.GetLocalizedStringAsync`.
- System Locale Selector will now only output the message The Locale X is not available, however the parent locale Y is available. in the player.
- Updated Smart Format library to `aa9e4288612f79b86ab0cea36066797118d11a69` excluding the Nullable types support.
  - Fixed: Take an erroneous format string like `"this is {uncomplete"` (missing closing brace). Before v2.7.0 the parser handled `{uncomplete` as a `TextLiteral`, not as an erroneous `Placeholder`.
  - Fixed: Fixed issue where If the `Parser` encountered a `ParsingError.TooManyClosingBraces`, this closing brace was simply "swallowed-up". This way, the result with `Parser.ErrorAction.MaintainTokens` differs from the original format string. From v2.7.0, the redundant closing brace is handled as a `TextLiteral`. 
  - Improved: For `ParsingError.TrailingOperatorsInSelector` and `ParsingError.InvalidCharactersInSelector` the causing character is now included in the `Exception.Message`.
  - Fix: Fully implemented all `Settings.ParseErrorAction`.
  - Enhanced SubString extension as described in [PR142](https://github.com/axuno/SmartFormat/pull/142).
- Updated to Addressables `1.18.2`.

- Fixed `ArgumentException` when adding a new table collection in a new project. ([LOC-192](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-thrown-first-time-entering-play-mode))
- Fixed `LocalizeStringEvent` overwriting the `StringReference` Arguments when enabled.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` in LoadTableOperation when the Locale could not be found. ([LOC-192](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-thrown-first-time-entering-play-mode))
- Fixed `TemplateFormatter` not being added when selected through the Add Formatter menu. (LOC-179)
- Fixed default table version of `GetLocalizedStringAsync` arguments being wrapped in an `object[]` when using `IList<object>`. (LOC-191)
- Fixed Localized assets not using fallbacks.
- Fixed table name validation - names can no longer contain leading or trailing whitespace, nor can they contain characters that Unity considers invalid. ([LOC-183](https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/LOC-183))
- Fixed warning regarding `SelectedLocale` being thrown when entering play mode and the **Scene Controls Window** was open.
- Locale Analyzer, String Table Analyzer and Asset Table Analyzer will now check the Addressables groups have valid schemas. (LOC-190)
- Table Window now updates itself when Tables, Collections or Shared Table Data is deleted or restored in the project. (LOC-182)

## [1.0.0-pre.8] - 2021-04-27

### Changed

- Changed to Pre-release.

## [0.11.1] - 2021-04-23

### Fixed

- Fixed errors being generated when using Play Mode with Domain and Scene reload disabled. ([LOC-165](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-thrown-when-entering-playmode-and-using-enter-play-mode-options-experimental))
- Fixed `NotSupportedException: Collection is read-only` error sometimes being produced by preload operation.

## [0.11.0] - 2021-04-08

### Added

- Added **Addressable Group Rules** asset. This can be used to configure what Addressable groups assets should be placed into. See Addressables Integration docs for further details.
- Added `CollectionExtension.Initialize`, this will be called when the extension is first added to a table collection.
- Added `IEntryOverride`. This can be used to create overrides for table entries to direct to different localized values.
- Added `Locale.LocaleName` property. This can be used to customize the name of the Locale instead of using the name of the Locale Asset in the `name` property. ([LOC-144](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-locale-assets-name-is-not-saved-when-renaming-it-through-the-inspector))
- Added `LocalizationEditorSettings.GetPsuedoLocales`. This returns all Pseudo Locales that are included in the project.
- Added `LocalizedGameObjectEvent` component. This can be used to localize Prefabs.
- Added `LocalizedMaterial` & `LocalizedGameObject`.
- Added `PlatformOverride` **Metadata**. This can be used to override the value for an entry for a chosen platform, the override can change the entry, table or both.
- Added `ReleaseAsset` method in `AssetTable`. This can be used to release an asset from memory for the provided AssetTableEntry.
- Added `ReleaseTables` to `LocalizedDatabase`. This can be used to force a table to be released from the database so that it may be unloaded providing there are no other references to it.
- Added `SetEntryAssetType` and `GetEntryAssetType` to `AssetTableCollection.`. This can be used to control the expected asset type for an entry.
- Added `SharedEntry` property to `StringTableEntry` and `AssetTableEntry`. This will return the `SharedTableData` entry for the current Locale specific entry.
- Added `SharedStringTableEntry` and `SharedAssetTableEntry` to `MetadataType`. These can be used to only show **Metadata** for a shared table entry only.
- Added 3 new Addressable Analyzer rules which can be used to check for Addressable issues and upgrade when changing the **Addressable Group Rules**.
- Added additional override for `StringTableEntry.GetLocalized` which allows for passing in an optional **Pseudo Locale**. By default the **Selected Locale** will be used. (LOC-162)
- Added constructors to `LocalizedString`, `LocalizedAsset`, `LocalizedStringTable` and `LocalizedAssetTable`. These show the minimum arguments required for the class to function correctly.
- Added extra override for method `GetLocalizedString` which now accepts the parameters as list of objects [IList<object>].
- Added language change menu to Device Simulator window.
- Added metadata support to **LocalizationSettings**.
- Added method `TableEntryReference.ToString(TableReference)`. This will use the `TableReference` to gather additional data such as the **Key** or **Key Id**.
- Added support for localizing **Android App name**. Only the **Display Name** is currently supported on the Android Platform. To configure the Android App add the **Android/AppInfo** metadata to the LocalizationSettings.
- Added support for localizing Android app Icon. We currently support  Adaptive Icon, Round Icon, and Legacy Icon on the Android Platform. To configure the Android app icons, add the Android/Android Adaptive Icon or Android/Android Round Icon or Android/Android Legacy Icon metadata to the LocalizationSettings.
- Added support for localizing iOS App components. Display Name, Microphone description, Camera description and Location description are currently supported. To configure the iOS App, add the **iOS/AppInfo** metadata to the **LocalizationSettings**.
- Added the functionality to **Preview Localization** without entering Play mode. Do this through the **Localization Scene Controls** window. See Edit Mode Support docs for further details.
- Added UI validation hints for table collection creation.
- When a `TableReference` is a Guid type, the `TableCollectionName` will now attempt to resolve the name from the `AssetDatabase` or `LocalizationSettings`. This is particularly helpful when debugging as `ToString` will now also contain the `TableCollectionName` as well as the `Guid`.

### Changed

- `MetadataAttribute.AllowMultiple` is now respected. Metadata that already exists will now be disabled in the add menu.
- Changed `LocalizedString.Arguments` to be an `IList<object>` instead of `object[]`.
- Changed table collection names so they can no longer be comprised of whitespace, cannot contain invalid filename characters, and cannot contain "[]".

- Renamed `StringUnityEvent` to `UnityEventString`.
- Updated **Addressables** to **1.17.15**.

### Fixed

- `StringTableEntry.GetLocalizedString` variants now use the table's locale formatter if no formatter is provided.

- Fixed a bug where invoking `RemoveKey` was not removing the Keys from other tables. Now, this is handled by abstract overrides in StringTableCollection and AssetTableCollection.
- Fixed corruption of PlayerSettings preloaded assets when building with the **InputSystem** package in the project. ([LOC-146](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-slash-inputsystem-asset-is-not-removed-from-preloaded-assets-list))
- Fixed Editor becoming unresponsive when using the **Google Sheets Service Authorize** button. (LOC-166)

## [0.10.0] - 2021-01-20

### Added 

- Added `GetDefaultTableAsync` to `LocalizedDatabase`. This can be used to get the DefaultTable directly. 
- Added `HasChangeHandler` to `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset`. ([LOC-111](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-unable-to-check-if-registerchangehandler-is-null-when-using-localisestringevent))
- Added `GenerateCharacterSet` to `StringTable` and `StringTableCollection`. This can be used to extract the unique characters used by 1 or more `String Tables`. This could then be used with a Font Atlas creator. It is also possible to export a **Character Set** file from the Export menu of the String Table window, the String Table Collection window, or the Localization Tables window.
- Added new Google Sheets example `SmartStringColumn` for synchronizing the Smart String property of an entry.
- Added **Global Variables** to **Smart Strings**. **Global Variables** can be defined in a `GlobalVariableGroup` asset which can then be added to a `GlobalVariableSource` in the **Smart Format Sources** list. Variables can then be referenced in a **Smart String** without the need to pass arguments. For example: `{group-name.variable-name}`. When a `GlobalVariables` value is changed via script, it will automatically trigger any `LocalizedString` that is using it to refresh. See Samples and docs for further details.
- Added `HasTagMetadata` to `TableEntry`.
- Added PreLoadTables to LocalizedDatabase. This can be used to force tables to be loaded, including their contents without having to set the preload flag in the editor.
- Added fallback support. When a localized value is missing then the Locale fallback metadata or CultureInfo will be used to find a suitable fallback Locale. This can be enabled project-wide through the Localization Settings String Database or Asset Database, it can also be configured on a per-item basis for LocalizedStrings.
- Added useFallback parameter to LocalizedStringDatabase.GetLocalizedStringAsync & LocalizedDatabase.GetTableEntryAsync. This can be used as a flag to enable FallBack behavior for Locales that have missing translations.
- Added Custom Locale UI Window. This can be used to add any custom Locales that are not supported in CultureInfo class or the SystemLanguage.
- Added **Preloading Screen** sample. This shows how you can wait for the `InitializationOperation` to complete.

### Changed
- Reduced the amount of garbage being generated by requests for localized strings and assets. The operations inside of `AsyncOperationHandle` are now returned in the subsequent frame after completion. If you wish to hold onto an `AsyncOperationHandle` you should call `Addressables.ResourceManager.Acquire` to prevent the operation being reused and `Addressables.Release` to allow for it to be reused.
- Merged all Third Party dependencies into a single library **Unity.Localization.ThirdParty.Editor.dll**. This will prevent conflicts when projects/packages use the same libraries. **Google Sheets**, **Newtonsoft Json** and **CsvHelper** can still be accessed by adding **Unity.Localization.ThirdParty.Editor** as an **Assembly Reference** to your own asmdef files.
- Removed dependency on package **com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json**. It is now part of the combined dependencies.
- Updated Third Party dependencies. Google Sheets to v.1.49.0.2111, CsvHelper to 15.0.9 and Newtonsoft.Json to 12.0.3.
- Clicking the **Localized Table Collection** name label will now toggle the selector foldout for `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset`. ([LOC-125](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-125))
- Significant improvements to **Smart String** overall performance. Testing showed results of an average of 10x less garbage and runs 2-3x faster.
- Updated **Smart Strings** with changes from **SmartFormat** v2.5.3.0-preview1.
  - Internal string comparisons (i.e. for placeholder names) are no more culture-specific, but Ordinal or OrdinalIgnoreCase respectively.
  - ListFormatter will now process IList data sources only.
  - Removed **SmartObjects**
- Updated to **Addressables** 1.6.13. 
- It's now possible to import `StringTableCollections` and `AssetTableCollections` into new or existing projects. When importing the Collection will create/update the Addressables and create any missing Locales in the project.
- Changed sample **Language Selection Menu (UGUI)** to use the Native name for Locales.
- The `Localization Tables` window search field is no longer cleared when changing selected table.
- After pulling from a **Google Sheet**, the order of the keys in the table will now match the order of the **Google Sheet**.
- When pushing to a **Google Sheet**, Table entries will no longer be sorted by the Key Id but keep their current order, as shown in the table editor window.
- It is now possible to use a **Google Sheet** with Sheet Id 0.
- Creating a new `LocalizationSettings` asset in the **Project Settings** window no longer selects the asset.
- Setting `LocalizedString` `Arguments` will now trigger `RefreshString`.
- `LocalizedString.RefreshString` will no longer throw an exception if there are no `StringChanged` subscribers.
- `LocalizedStrings` that are **Smart** will always use **Smart Format** even when no arguments have been provided.
- Culture-sensitive formatting now uses the `Locale` information.
- The `Localization Tables` window search field is no longer cleared when changing selected table.
- The `Localization Tables` window search field is no longer cleared when changing selected table.
- No Translation Found message is now a Smart String and has access to several placeholders which can be used to proivide details on the missing entry. 

### Fixed
- Fixed exceptions being thrown when trying to load a table that does not exist. Loading missing String Tables will now use the missing translation message instead of throwing an exception when a table was missing and assets will return a failed operation handle. (LOC-120)
- Fixed DefaultTable property throwing an invalid key exception when it is empty. Now getting a value from empty DefaultTable will throw an exception. 
- The LocalizedAsset selector will now filter out incompatible types. ([LOC-123](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localizedasset-property-drawer-does-not-filter-by-type))
- Fixed **LocalizedString** Editor not preserving new items added to the Preview Arguments field. ([LOC-122](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/new-items-are-not-added-to-the-preview-arguments-list-in-the-localizedstring-field-when-pressing-the-plus-icon))
- Fixed `AddTagMetadata` creating a new tag each time instead of using an existing tag. `RemoveTagMetadata` will now remove all empty tag entries, not just the first one it finds. ([LOC-124](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/smart-format-tag-in-the-metadata-stays-after-disabling-the-smart-option-when-smart-option-is-enabled-on-another-entry))
- **String Table Entries** which have a null or empty localized string will now be treated as missing translations and use the `No Translation Found Format`. ([LOC-126](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-no-translation-found-format-variable-isnt-used-when-an-entry-locale-is-empty))
- Fixed exception when calling GetLocale and no Addressables settings exists in the project.
- Fixed **XLIFF 2.0** generating empty **notes** nodes. ([LOC-131](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-export-xliff-generates-table-with-notes-node-when-notes-are-not-added))
- Fixed **Google Sheets** `PullEnd` not being called after pulling from a Google Sheet. ([LOC-133](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/googlesheets-does-not-call-pullend-on-custom-columns))
- **Google Sheets** `PullCellData` is now called for all cells even if the sheet cell is empty. (LOC-134)
- Pulling a **Google Sheet** using an **API Key** will now use the correct public API and no longer produce authorization errors. ([LOC-139](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-using-api-key-to-retrieve-data-outputs-request-is-missing-required-authentication-credential-expected-oauth-2))
- Calling `LocalizationEditorSettings.GetLocales` will no longer create a new Addressable Assets Settings file if one does not exist. ([LOC-142](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/a-new-addresableassetsdata-folder-is-created-when-recompiling-a-script-while-the-localization-tables-window-is-open))
- Fixed a bug where the Locales list were not been updated, when the New Table tab is open and the Locale name was changed.
- Improved `LocalizationSetting` editor performance. The editor is now using UI Toolkit to render and should be much smoother. (LOC-90)
- Fixed **Smart String** editor becoming corrupted when a parsing exception was thrown in the **Debug** view.
- Fixed exception being thrown by `GetSourceExtension` and `GetFormatterExtension` when no value could be found.
- Fixed `LocalizedAsset` Property Drawer not resolving the asset type when displaying a list of `LocalizedAssets`.
- Fixed preloaded Sprite assets having the incorrect type(Texture). ([LOC-142](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-143))

## [0.9.0] - 2020-10-27

### Added
- Added support for exporting and importing `StringTables` and `StringTableCollections` as XML Localisation Interchange File Format (XLIFF). XLIFF version [1.2](https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html) and [2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.0/os/xliff-core-v2.0-os.html) are both supported. See docs for further details.

### Changed
- Updated to Addressables version **1.16.6**.
- Editor Foldout fields now toggle when clicking on the label.
- When enabling preload on Asset Tables, all assets will now be preloaded by default instead of requiring the `PreloadAssetTable` Metadata. Adding a `PreloadAssetTable` can be used to disable this default behavior. ([LOC-114](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localized-audio-clips-fail-to-load-on-first-retrieval-when-using-loadassetasync))
- `SmartFormat` editor will now show parsing and format errors in the preview field.
- Added title header to Google Sheets extension property drawer.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in `PreloadDatabaseOperation` that caused it to complete before preloading was finished. ([LOC-114](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localized-audio-clips-fail-to-load-on-first-retrieval-when-using-loadassetasync))
- Fixed Tables Window throwing exceptions when editing a collection which had 1 or more tables without a matching locale in the project.
- Fixed `ProjectSettings.asset` being modified on disc during a build.
- Fixed `LocalizedString` property drawer throwing `NullReferenceException` when selecting a Localization Table Collection which did not have a table for every Locale in the project. ([LOC-118](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-thrown-when-editing-a-localizedstring-linked-to-a-collection-that-does-not-have-a-table-for-every-project-locale))
- Calling `AddKey` will now check if the new Id is already in use and generate a new Id if it is. This means it is now safe to use custom Id values.
- `SharedTableData` that contains an empty Guid will now be repaired when loaded in the editor.
- Fixed `SmartFormat` editor becoming corrupt when showing preview and `ThrowException` action was enabled in ParseError or FormatError. [(LOC-119)(https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-ui-is-broken-when-editing-a-smart-string-and-throwexceptions-error-mode-is-enabled)]
- Increased max width for `Localization Tables` window Id field so large keys can be fully visible.

## [0.8.1] - 2020-08-19

### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect Further Reading URL in Pseudo-Localization documentation page.
- Fixed changes to tables not being saved due to them not being set dirty when edited through the Table Editor.

## [0.8.0] - 2020-08-17

### Added
- Added `IKeyGenerator` to `SharedTableData`. This is now used to generate the unique ids for each key. By default `DistributedUIDGenerator` will be used to generate the keys however it is possible to change it back to Sequential by assigning `SequentialIDGenerator` to `SharedTableData.KeyGenerator`. See docs for further details.
- Added `PreserveTags` Pseudo-localization method. This will prevent tags such as rich text or xml from being modified by any subsequent Pseudo-localization methods. ([LOC-86](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/pseudo-localization-methods-are-applied-to-the-whole-string-when-using-rich-text-tags))

- Added `LocalizedStringTable` and `LocalizedAssetTable`. These work in a similar way to `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset` but will return a Table instead of a single table entry.
- Added new Sample: Simple Language Selection Menu (IMGUI). Includes 2 different examples of a Locale selection menu.

### Changed
- Changed Table Entry Key Id data type from `uint` to `long`. All Methods that were using a `uint` now require a `long`.
- `IPseudoLocalizationMethod` method `Transform` now passes a `Message` instead of a string.
- The Locale column order in the `Localization Tables` window is now determined by the Locale's order.
- Upgraded to latest `Newtonsoft Json` package `2.0.0`.

- Replaced `LocalizedAsset` `RegisterChangeHandler` and `ClearChangeHandler` with the event `AssetChanged`.

### Fixed

- Fixed StringTableCollection assets not being set dirty when pulling from a Google Sheet in the editor. ([1240528](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/undo-does-not-set-assets-dirty-when-using-iserializationcallbackreceiver))
- Fixed StringTableCollection assets not being set dirty when pulling from a Google Sheet in the editor.

- Fixed serialization errors `Should not occur! Internal logic error: please report bug.` when `Comment Metadata` was attached to the table or shared table data. (LOC-104)
- Fixed `LocalizedDatabase.GetTableAsync` trying to load an already loaded `LocalizedTable` when using a GUID TableReference. This was causing preloaded tables to still require some loading.
- Fixed "LocalizationSettings has a different serialization layout" error. Moved the `Locale GameView Menu` property from LocalizationSettings to EditorPrefs and moved the menu option into `Preference/Localization`. (LOC-99)
- Fixed `GoogleSheets` push not handling Table entries that were missing matching Shared Table Entries, this would cause future rows to be blank. ([LOC-102](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-102))
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` in `Localization Settings` when Editor window focus was lost and Smart Format properties field was visible. ([LOC-101](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-101))

- `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset` property drawers now remember the expanded state of each Locale field when an Undo/Redo occurs. ([LOC-105](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/undoing-a-change-to-a-language-in-the-localizedstring-inspector-resets-the-folded-state))
- Added Undo support when adding and removing a table from a `StringTableCollection` or `AssetTableCollection`. When Undo is not used the asset will be set dirty so changes are not lost. ([LOC-107](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-107))

## [0.7.1] - 2020-06-05

### Added
- Added `StringTableCollection` and `AssetTableCollection`. These are editor only assets for controlling a collection of string or asset tables. Tables that are not part of a collection will now be ignored. To upgrade old table assets select one and press the `Create Collection` button in the inspector.
- Added Google Sheets support. A `StringTableCollection` can by pushed and pulled by using the `Google Sheets Extension` in the editor or through script with the `GoogleSheets` class. Table entry values, comments and metadata can be synced to a Google Sheet. This is currently an Editor only feature.
- Added `DisplayName` attribute. This is an optional attribute for `Metadata` and `CollectionExtensions` so that a custom name that can be displayed in the editor instead of the class name.
