# About Localization
The Localization package provides tools for adding support for multiple languages and regional variants to your application (for example, supporting text in multiple languages or culture-specific Assets such as audio or textures).

To get started, check the [Installation](Installation.md) and [Quick Start Guide](QuickStartGuide.md) sections.
